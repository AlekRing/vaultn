**Deployed Test Case:**

You can view the deployed test case here: [Test Case Demo](https://vaultn-fawn.vercel.app/)

1. **Clarify & Validate Requirements**  
   - Consult AI to ensure the task is fully understood and clarify any ambiguities.

2. **Initial Code Generation**  
   - Prompt AI to generate a foundational code structure or solution outline.

3. **Review & Manual Adjustments**  
   - Examine the generated code, incorporate personal expertise, and make custom refinements.

4. **Iterative Debugging & Error Localization**  
   - Use AI to identify and pinpoint errors quickly.

5. **Ask AI for Error Fixes**  
   - Request specific solutions or alternative approaches from AI to resolve issues.

6. **Style & UX Enhancements**  
   - Consult AI for improving readability, maintainability, and user experience.

7. **Model Switching & Fine‑Tuning**  
   - Switch or tune AI models for optimal suggestions when one model’s results are insufficient.

8. **AI Critique & Code Polishing**  
   - Have AI critique the current solution to discover overlooked improvements.

9. **Repeat & Refine**  
   - Combine AI’s speed with your judgment, iterating until the final solution is robust and efficient.

**Tools Used:**
- **ChatGPT** for generation, debugging, and refining code. Specifically o1, 4o and o3-mini-high models
- **Claude** for cross-validating and fine-tuning the outputs generated by ChatGPT.
